1. I need the UI for my fragment_msg to follow a certain criteria.
2. This is the current code I have:
<LinearLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    android:orientation="vertical"
    android:gravity="center">

    <Button
        android:id="@+id/button_request_permission"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:text="Request Permission"
        tools:ignore="HardcodedText" />

</LinearLayout>
3. I need the UI to fllow more of these guide lines:
Create UI with appropriate design elements to prompt a user for permission
to communicate with the text messaging app and display information based on
 permission (1 screen). Your UI will need to include a button, or alternate
  mechanism, that would cause the app to ask a user for permissions so it can
   communicate with SMS messaging. A user that grants permission will then receive
    automated system notifications based on which option you chose in Project One.
     These notifications would be low inventory, an upcoming event,
      or reaching a goal weight. If the user denies access to the permissions
      needed for the app to interact with SMS, then your app should still continue
       to function overall but should not provide any notifications.
4. worry about the UI and less on the functionality.
